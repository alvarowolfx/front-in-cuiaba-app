# FrontInCuiaba App
This app was developed for demo purposes for the talk that I gave at Front In Cuiaba event at 2015 ([link for the presentation](alvarowolfx.github.io/ionic-present)). So I'm sharing the code for those who are interested in studying Ionic Framework.

## Pre requirements
- Node.js and NPM installed (I recommend to do something like [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install global packages without sudo )
- Ionic CLI installed, use this command to install globally the ionic command :
```shell
npm install -g ionic
```

## How to run
- Install required npm packages, run this command on project folder :
```shell
npm install
```
- Start ionic livereload server
```shell
ionic serve
```
